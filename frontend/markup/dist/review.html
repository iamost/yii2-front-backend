            <div class="plain-text-block">
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Identity Guard Features</h2>
                <p><span class="s1">Identity Guard organizes its extensive feature into three broad categories that offer multiple protections against identity theft. The company&rsquo;s cutting edge technology constantly monitors customer personal and financial transactions to prevent identity theft from destroying everything you own.</span></p>
                <h2>Monitoring</h2>
                <p>During every business day, Identity Guard uses advanced technology to scrutinize customer credit files meticulously. The company immediately alerts customers to credit file changes, as well as receives monthly credit score updates from the three major credit bureaus.</p>
                <p><span class="s1">Identity Guard also closely monitors personal information that includes your name and Social Security number. Public record monitoring ensures an identity thief has not stolen your identity and then committed a crime. Customers select the types of alerts they want, including tests, emails, and phone alerts.</span></p>
                <h2>Computer Protection</h2>
                <p>The days of identity thieves opening the mail of victims have gone the way of snail mail. Now, identity thieve invade tablets, laptops, and desktops to steal your identity. Identity Guard created the ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite that customers download for antivirus, anti-spyware, and firewall protection.</p>
                <p><span class="s1">The company also uses proprietary technology to secure your login and credit card information. Keystroke encryption software called PrivacyProtect encrypts every one of your computer keystrokes to prevent malware from snatching your personal information.</span></p>
                <h2><span class="s1">Identity Recovery</span></h2>
                <p><span class="s1">Compromised personal and financial information creates a labyrinth of problems that sometimes gives victims no hope of restoring their good names. Identity Guard offers Personal Recovery Assistance, which is a feature helps you cancel credit cards and provides advice on the steps to take for contacting lenders and law enforcement. Customers victimized by identity thieves call a toll free number to talk with an identity theft expert employed by Identity Guard. Moreover, Identity Guard offers identity theft insurance and lost wallet protection.</span></p>
                <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Identity Guard Pricing</strong></h2>
                <p><span class="s1">Identity Guard offer three pricing plans that vary on price and the number of identity theft services.</span></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><span class="s1">Identity Guard Essentials: </span></strong><br />The most basic Identity Guard pricing plan costs $9.99 per month. The Essentials plan offers the most basic identity theft features, such as Social Security number monitoring and $1 million in identity theft insurance. As with the other two plans, customers pay only $5 for the first 30 days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity Guard Total Protection: </strong><br />At only $19.99, Identity Guard customers receive all of the features that come with the Essentials plan, as well as several more features that include quarterly credit scores, public record monitoring, three bureau credit report updates, and personal computer antivirus protection.</li>
                    <li><strong><strong>Identity Guard Platinum:</strong> </strong><br />The Identity Guard Platinum pricing plan offers everything in the Total Protection plan, with monthly instead of quarterly credit scores. Identity Guard&rsquo;s premium pricing plan includes three types of memberships that cover individuals, couples, or families. The individual plan costs $19.99 per month, the couple plan costs $22.99 per month covering two adults, and at $24.99 per month, the family pricing plan covers two adults and up to 15 children living in the same household.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><strong>The Pros and Cons of Identity Guard</strong></h2>
                <p>Online reviews from both consumers and identity theft services experts place Identity Guard at the top of the list of identity theft services companies. Identity Guard especially delivers an easy to sign up process, prompt identity theft assistance, extensive credit card monitoring information, and expert customer service that quickly responds to phone and online queries.</p>
                <h3><strong>Credit Report Monitoring Accuracy</strong></h3>
                <p>Scour the Internet for Identity Guard reviews and you should come away with the impression that not only does Identity Guard deliver prompt credit reports, the company also presents customers with accurate information. Identity Guard scans all three of your credit files daily to notify you of changes that impact your credit score. The alerts go out in a timely manner via emails, text messages, and phone calls. We applaud the company for encouraging customers to receive alerts through all three communication channels to ensure immediate action.</p>
                <p>Websites devoted to reviewing identity theft services companies almost universally praise Identity Guard for providing the contact information of every creditor listed on your credit reports. This saves you time and gets the credit correction ball rolling quickly. Perhaps the biggest pro for the Identity Guard credit report monitoring service is Credit Analyzer, which comprises an online tool that allows you see how financial actions affect your credit score. Very few other identity theft services companies offer such a powerful credit score calculating feature. As mentioned in myriad online reviews, Identity Guard ranks high among similar companies by providing services, such as credit report monitoring, that extend well beyond identity theft protection.</p>
                <p>A few customers complained about delays in receiving alerts, but you can attribute that to incomplete information submitted on the alert form. The easy to use form takes just a few minutes to complete.</p>
                <h3><strong>Identity Theft Assistance</strong></h3>
                <p>If you discover that one or more identity thieves have poached some of your financial resources and personal information, Identity Guard doesn&rsquo;t turn its back on frantic customers. Unlike other companies in the same niche, the company gives you $1 million in identity theft insurance coverage, as well as direct contact with the company&rsquo;s Identity Theft Recovery Unit. The only downside to the insurance is that most, if not all creditors don&rsquo;t hold victims liable for transactions made by identity thieves. Still, it&rsquo;s nice to have the peace of mind that Identity Guard has your back.</p>
                <p>However, you must send considerable time repairing the damage done by identity thieves. You might lose your strong credit score, which means lenders and credit card companies refuse to give you credit. The Identity Guard Identity Theft Recovery Unit minimizes the time and money you spend attempting to restore your previous credit rating. We meticulously researched Identity Guard&rsquo;s highly effective theft recovery service, and we couldn&rsquo;t find even slightly negative feedback from both consumers and industry experts.</p>
                <h3><strong>Knowledgeable Customer Service</strong></h3>
                <p>Identity Guard&rsquo;s highly rated member center allows you to see the status of your protections. The member center also presents updated information on what features and protection you have available to use. Identity Guard smartly encourages customers to register bank and credit cards immediately to prevent a timing gap that identity thieves exploit. The company provides both phone and online customer service, with phone service receiving the higher customer service marks.</p>
                <p>On Monday through Friday, from 8am until 11pm EST, you have the option of contacting Identity Guard customer service by phone. That&rsquo;s an incredible 15-hour window to get customer issues resolved. Identity Guard offers phone customer service on Saturday from 9am to 6pm. We contacted Identity Guard and we were pleasantly surprised to hear a customer service expert just a few seconds after entering the automated phone system. Moreover, customers have the capability to report lost and stolen bank and credit cards by phone.</p>
                <h3><strong>Easy Sign Up</strong></h3>
                <p>The Identity Guard sign up page takes very little time to complete. You select the plan that matches your criteria and the Identity Guard website then guides you through a few screens that ask for your personal information, as well as your preferred payment method. There&rsquo;s never a lag in the time between when you complete the sign up page and when your identity protection commences. After Identity Guard confirms your information, you can review your credit scores and major bureau reports. You have to call customer service to ask for hard copies, although the copies cost nothing.</p>
                <section>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">We find Identity Guard to rank as the best identity theft services company in the industry for several reasons. Plan choices allow you to upgrade or downgrade, depending on your tolerance for identity theft risk. None of the pricing plans for the company exceeds $25 per month, as the top plan allows parents to add up to 15 children, at no charge. Identity Guard offers the most comprehensive identity theft protection, but the company takes identity theft services to the next level by also offering computer protection and credit score monitoring.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">For consumers that are serious about securing credit data and receiving the best identity theft protection, Identity Guard represents an affordable option that does the best job of keeping you safe from identity thieves.</p>
