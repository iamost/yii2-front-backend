            <article>
                <article>
                    <h3 class="h2-like">1. What is identity theft?</h3>
                    <p class="base-p">Identity theft is when someone fraudulently uses your identity without your knowledge or consent to gain benefits that you&rsquo;re entitled to. These could be medical, financial, legal or employment gains.</p>
                    <h3>2. What is child identity theft?</h3>
                    <p>When the identity of a minor / child is used for fraudulent activities, it is known as child identity theft. Criminals are usually interested in the social security numbers of children to steal their identity. Child identity theft is hard to detect because it remains unknown until the child grows up to apply for a credit card or driver&rsquo;s license.</p>
                    <h3>3. Do I need to worry about identity theft?</h3>
                    <p>Identity theft is real and everyone is susceptible to it. A report from Javelin Strategy suggests that in 2015, 13.1 million people became victims of identity theft. Hence everyone needs to take steps for identity theft protection.</p>
                    <h3>4. What is identity theft protection?</h3>
                    <p>Identity theft protection is the process of securing your personal data to prevent an identity theft from happening. This includes identity theft protection by an individual or by an identity theft protection service</p>
                    <h3>5. How can I protect my personal information?</h3>
                    <p>Protecting your personal information and your identity starts with basic security awareness. Secure your accounts with strong passwords. Never share your personal information with untrusted parties. Highly confidential data such as your credit card number, bank account information and social security number should never be revealed. Never visit unknown or suspicious websites. Lastly, have a plan that continuously monitors for fraudulent usage of your personal data.</p>
                    <h3>6. Why is continuous monitoring important?</h3>
                    <p>There&rsquo;s no foolproof way to prevent identity theft. Even with the best protection, there is always a chance of your data being leaked. Hence it is important to have a plan that continuously monitors for fraudulent usage of your data. A continuous monitoring plan can help in early detection of identity theft by alerting you when your data gets used and minimize the damage caused. It can assist with legal work and also help you recover from the damage with an insurance policy.</p>
                    <h3>7. What is a fraud alert?</h3>
                    <p>A fraud alert may be placed on your credit report by contacting any of the three credit bureaus to indicate that your identity may be at risk. These bureaus inform other lenders and creditors to perform additional checks to verify your identity before approving a loan or extending your credit line.</p>
                    <h3>8. What is an identity theft protection service?</h3>
                    <p>Identity theft protection continuously monitors the Internet to see if your personal data is being fraudulently used. It alerts you when your personal information such as bank account number, credit card number, social security number, driver&rsquo;s license etc. is used in a way that doesn&rsquo;t match with your credit report.</p>
                    <h3>9. What is identity theft insurance?</h3>
                    <p>Identity theft insurance can reimburse certain expenses that may be incurred as a result of identity theft. These could include attorney fees, lost wages reimbursement, costs for notarizing documents and loan application fees among others. Most identity theft protection services provide identity theft insurance.</p>
                    <h3>10. What do I do if my identity is stolen?</h3>
                    <p>If you think your identity has been stolen, you need to act quickly to reduce the damage. First call your bank or credit card company and notify them. This can prevent further usage of your card or bank account. Next call your law enforcement agency and file a report. Also place a fraud alert with any of the three credit bureaus.</p>
